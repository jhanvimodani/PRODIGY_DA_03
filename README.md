For my third task, I'll be venturing into the realm of predictive modeling by building a decision tree classifier. Using a dataset like the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I'll develop a model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data.

Excited to enhance my machine learning skills and derive actionable insights! Grateful for this opportunity to learn and grow at Prodigy InfoTech
